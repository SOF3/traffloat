# Happiness
Each inhabitant has their own happiness value.
Happiness gradually decreases when the inhabitant is performing an assigned job,
and gradually increases otherwise.
Happiness can be quickly restored by using [entertainment](../building#entertainment) facilities.
Lack of housing or supplies causes a sharp reduction in happiness.

When happiness drops below zero, the inhabitant becomes an *outlaw*,
at which point the inhabitant refuses to perform jobs assigned to them,
and they no longer use entertainment facilities to restore health.
Instead, they start performing random crimes,
which further reduce their own happiness.
They must be arrested by [police](../building/police-station) and placed in [prisons](../building/prison)
to gradually restore happiness to a positive value.
