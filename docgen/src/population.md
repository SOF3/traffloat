# Population
The space colony is operated by inhabitants.

## Birth
Inhabitants are produced by asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction

Asexual reproduction is performed manually in the [core](../buildings/core).
Given sufficient amount of [DNA](../cargo/dna) is available,
players can initiate asexual reproduction using the core building menu.
The created inhabitants will be assigned any random available housing in the colony.

Sexual reproduction is performed spontaneously in houses.
Two inhabitants living in the same colony will
randomly give birth to children based on their [happiness](../happiness).
Higher happiness results in higher probability of giving birth.
The child will be assigned to the same housing as its parents.

## Growth
*Main article: [Skill](../skill)*

Inhabitants are born with low skill points in each area.
Skill points increase slowly as age increases,
but can be boosted by attending [schools](../buildings#education).
Inhabitants operate vehicles or buildings more effectively
when they have higher skill points in the relevant areas.

## Happiness
*Main article: [Happiness](../happiness)*

Each inhabitant has their own happiness value.
Higher happiness results in higher effectiveness when operating buildings or vehicles.
When happiness drops below zero, they become outlaws who cause destruction to the colony.
